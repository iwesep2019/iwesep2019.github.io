        title: "Intelligence-Driven Software Engineering"
        description: "The present-day system of developing and distributing software relies on a sophisticated ecosystem of repositories that catalog virtually every aspect and every kind of artifact of a software's lifecycle. They include version control systems for source code, to bug tracking systems, to online developer and user discussion forums. These repositories, commonly referred to as Big Code, encapsulate vast amounts of human software development expertise, experience, and opinions. This has motivated a burgeoning field of research within software engineering that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, such as machine learning, to mine Big Code for relevant insights, i.e., \"intelligence\", and use it to power next-generation software engineering solutions. In this talk I will provide an overview of research conducted at Fujitsu Laboratories of America, in the area of intelligence-driven software engineering, in the context of the larger body of work in this upcoming area. In particular, I will discuss our research in the areas of automated testing, debugging and patching, as well as our efforts to translate this research into practical solutions to help real users to be more productive and to develop more correct and reliable software."

  # Speakers in the MSR Asia Summit session
  Summit:
    - name: "Dr. Fabio Palomba"
      photo: "/img/Fabio-Palomba.jpg"
      bio: "Dr. Fabio Palomba is an Assistant Professor of Software Engineering at the University of Salerno, Italy. He received the European PhD degree in Management & Information Technology in 2017. His PhD Thesis was the recipient of the 2017 IEEE Computer Society Best PhD Thesis Award (Italy section). His research interests include software maintenance and evolution, software testing, empirical software engineering, source code quality, and mining software repositories. He was the recipient of two ACM/SIGSOFT and one IEEE/TCSE Distinguished Paper Awards at ASE'13, ICSE'15, and ICSME'17, respectively, and Best Paper Awards at CSCW'18 and SANER'18. In 2019 he was the recipient of an SNSF Ambizione grant, one of the most prestigious individual research grants in Europe. He serves and has served as a program committee member of various international conferences (e.g., MSR, ICPC, ICSME), and as referee for various international journals (e.g., TSE, EMSE, JSS) in the field of software engineering. Fabio will be the program co-chair of ICPC 2021, which will be held in Madrid, Spain. Since 2016 he is Review Board Member of EMSE and, since 2019, Editorial Board Member of TOSEM, JSS, and SCICO. He was the recipient of five Distinguished/Outstanding Reviewer Awards for his reviewing activities conducted for EMSE, IST, and JSS between 2015 and 2019."

        title: "Test code quality: A New Measure of Test Code Effectiveness"
        description: "Test cases form the first line of defense against the introduction of software faults. In the past, researchers have been studying methods and tools to support developers during testing activities, mainly focusing on how to (1) measure the capabilities of test cases in finding real defects in production code and (2) provide them with automatically written tests. Despite this notable effort, the impact of test code quality has been mostly ignored. In this talk, I will show that this aspect has a critical impact on the effectiveness of tests and, particularly, on the presence of flaky tests as well as on the code coverage achievable by test cases automatically generated. Furthermore, I will discuss how test code quality can be employed for predictive analytics and assist developers when assessing test code effectiveness."
    - name: "Dr. Maurício Aniche"
      photo: "/img/Maurício-Aniche.jpg"
      bio: "Dr. Maurício Aniche is an Assistant Professor in Software Engineering at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. His line of work focuses on how to make developers more productive during maintenance and testing. His research has been published in top-tier conferences (ICSE, FSE, ASE) and journals (TSE, EMSE). He always had a foot in industry. During his MSc, he co-founded Alura, the biggest e-learning platform for software engineers in Brazil. Because of Alura, he has given training and consultancy on software development and testing to 27 different companies, from 2010 to 2015. Moreover, he published three books focused on practitioners (\"OOP and SOLID for ninjas\", \"Test-Driven Development in the real world\", and \"A Practical Guide on Software Testing\"), which, altogether, have sold 10k copies. All these activities have given him a very particular vision on software engineering and testing should be done in practice. Now, fully dedicated to academia, he still (desires and) partners up with companies. In the last two years, he has been working closely with Adyen, a Dutch payment unicorn. His work with the company has been published in prestigious venues such as FSE, as well as ICSE's and ICSME's industry tracks."

        title: "\"Testing in production\": A Gentle Walk on Monitoring Research"
        description: "\"Testing in production\" used to be a joke among developers. However, given the complexity of the large and distributed systems that take care of important parts of our lives, \"testing in development\", or, in other words, prevention, might not be enough anymore. In this talk, I'll discuss the importance of systems monitoring, logging, and log analysis to modern software systems. I'll reflect on the current state-of-the-art in industry and research fields, as well as the current open challenges. A great part of this talk is based on the research we conducted at Adyen, a large-scale payment company, that serves companies such as Facebook, Uber, and Spotify."
