  <p>
    The 10th International Workshop on Empirical Software Engineering in Practice (IWESEP 2019) will be held at
    <a href="https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/access/nishiwaseda-campus">Nishiwaseda Campus of Waseda University</a>.
    The workshop room will be located on the first floor of <b>Building No. 55, N Tower</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nishiwaseda campus is located at a very convenient place in Tokyo.
    There are three train stations near that campus.
    <ul>
      <li>
          [Tokyo Metro] Fukutoshin line, <b>Nishi-Waseda</b> (西早稲田 / <i>F11</i>) Station (3 min on foot)
      </li>
      <li>
          [JR] Yamanote line, <b>Takadanobaba</b> (高田馬場 / <i>JY15</i>) Station (13 min on foot)
      </li>
      <li>
          [JR] Yamanote line, <b>Shin-Okubo</b> (新大久保 / <i>JY16</i>) Station (15 min on foot)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p >
    Using Nishi-Waseda station is the most convenient option to get to the workshop venue.
    If you are getting off at Nishi-Waseda station, please leave from Exit 3 (not Exit 1 or 2). This exit will take you
    directly to the campus. Building No. 55, where the workshop will be held, stands very closely to that exit.
    Be aware that it will take a few minutes walk if you use other exits.

    <h4 class="speech-abst">Talk Abstract</h4>
    <p class="speech-abst">The present-day system of developing and distributing software relies on a sophisticated ecosystem of repositories that catalog virtually every aspect and every kind of artifact of a software&#39;s lifecycle. They include version control systems for source code, to bug tracking systems, to online developer and user discussion forums. These repositories, commonly referred to as Big Code, encapsulate vast amounts of human software development expertise, experience, and opinions. This has motivated a burgeoning field of research within software engineering that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, such as machine learning, to mine Big Code for relevant insights, i.e., &#34;intelligence&#34;, and use it to power next-generation software engineering solutions. In this talk I will provide an overview of research conducted at Fujitsu Laboratories of America, in the area of intelligence-driven software engineering, in the context of the larger body of work in this upcoming area. In particular, I will discuss our research in the areas of automated testing, debugging and patching, as well as our efforts to translate this research into practical solutions to help real users to be more productive and to develop more correct and reliable software.</p>

    <h4 class="speech-abst">Talk Abstract</h4>
    <p class="speech-abst">Test cases form the first line of defense against the introduction of software faults. In the past, researchers have been studying methods and tools to support developers during testing activities, mainly focusing on how to (1) measure the capabilities of test cases in finding real defects in production code and (2) provide them with automatically written tests. Despite this notable effort, the impact of test code quality has been mostly ignored. In this talk, I will show that this aspect has a critical impact on the effectiveness of tests and, particularly, on the presence of flaky tests as well as on the code coverage achievable by test cases automatically generated. Furthermore, I will discuss how test code quality can be employed for predictive analytics and assist developers when assessing test code effectiveness.</p>

    <h4 class="speakers-bio">Speaker Biography</h4>
    <p class="speakers-bio">Dr. Fabio Palomba is an Assistant Professor of Software Engineering at the University of Salerno, Italy. He received the European PhD degree in Management &amp; Information Technology in 2017. His PhD Thesis was the recipient of the 2017 IEEE Computer Society Best PhD Thesis Award (Italy section). His research interests include software maintenance and evolution, software testing, empirical software engineering, source code quality, and mining software repositories. He was the recipient of two ACM/SIGSOFT and one IEEE/TCSE Distinguished Paper Awards at ASE&#39;13, ICSE&#39;15, and ICSME&#39;17, respectively, and Best Paper Awards at CSCW&#39;18 and SANER&#39;18. In 2019 he was the recipient of an SNSF Ambizione grant, one of the most prestigious individual research grants in Europe. He serves and has served as a program committee member of various international conferences (e.g., MSR, ICPC, ICSME), and as referee for various international journals (e.g., TSE, EMSE, JSS) in the field of software engineering. Fabio will be the program co-chair of ICPC 2021, which will be held in Madrid, Spain. Since 2016 he is Review Board Member of EMSE and, since 2019, Editorial Board Member of TOSEM, JSS, and SCICO. He was the recipient of five Distinguished/Outstanding Reviewer Awards for his reviewing activities conducted for EMSE, IST, and JSS between 2015 and 2019.</p>
