<p itemprop="description">
    IWESEP 2019 is a research forum to discuss research methods and tools on software engineering as well as
    findings
    from applying these technologies in academic or industrial settings.
    It encourages researchers, engineers, and practitioners to exchange their research ideas and expectations on
    empirical software engineering. We believe that this workshop is a good opportunity for academic researchers
    and
    industrial engineers/practitioners to develop and deepen collaborative networks among them.
