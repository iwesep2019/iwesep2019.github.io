<p>The 10th International Workshop on Empirical Software Engineering in Practice (IWESEP) aims to foster the development of the field by providing a forum where researchers and practitioners reports on and discuss research results and applications in the area of empirical software engineering. The workshop encourages the exchange of ideas within the international community to better understand, from an empirical viewpoint, the strengths and weaknesses of novel and current technology, with the expectation of furthering the field of software engineering.</p>
<!-- <p>The workshop welcomes both original and replicated studies, varying from controlled experiments to field studies, from quantitative to qualitative. The workshop also welcomes reports on the application of existing software engineering technologies in industrial settings.</p> -->
<h3>Submission Categories</h3>
<p>The workshop provides two submission categories: Full Research Papers and Posters.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Full Research Papers: </b> Papers in this category must not exceed 6 pages. At least three program committee members will evaluate each submission. All the accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings with an IEEE catalog number and ISBN. The proceedings will be submitted to IEEE Xplore for publication. For each accepted paper, at least one of the authors must register for and attend the workshop to make an oral presentation of the paper.</li>
  <li><b>Posters: </b> Authors in this category should submit an abstract (max 700 words) on the content to be presented in the poster, describing the motivation, methodology, results, and contribution of the study. The submitted abstracts will be quickly reviewed by the program committee chairs to check whether they meet the scope of the workshop. The authors of the accepted submissions will be requested to prepare the posters and bring them to the workshop venue. Note that the submissions in this category will not appear in the workshop proceedings.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the submissions must be in English, and must be submitted electronically before the due date via EasyChair. <br><code>https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwesep2019</code><br>
<!-- Note that both of the categories share the same submission page, and the categories are differentiated by the <code>Topics</code> attribute.<br>
Please make sure that you have selected the correct category before submission, otherwise your submission might not be reviewed.</p> -->
