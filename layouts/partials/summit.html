<h2 class="section-title">MSR Asia Summit Session</h2>

<p>
  IWESEP 2019 will have MSR Asia Summit session, in which we will invite leading researchers in the field of MSR (Mining Software Repositories).
  It provides participants with opportunities to learn the cutting edge of the research related to MSR. <br>

  This year, we have invited Dr. Fabio Palomba from the Zurich Empirical Software Engineering Team (ZEST) of the University of Zurich, Switzerland.
  You can find the talk abstract and the speaker biography below.

<!-- <h4>Speaker</h4>
<p>
  Dr. Mukul Prasad, <em>Director in the Advanced Software &amp; Algorithms Laboratory at Fujitsu Laboratories of
    America</em>
  ​</p>
<h4>Title</h4>
<p>
  Intelligence-Driven Software Engineering
  ​</p>
<h4>Talk Abstract</h4>
<p>
  The present-day system of developing and distributing software relies on a sophisticated ecosystem of repositories
  that catalog virtually every aspect and every kind of artifact of a software&#39;s lifecycle. They include version
  control systems for source code, to bug tracking systems, to online developer and user discussion forums. These
  repositories, commonly referred to as Big Code, encapsulate vast amounts of human software development expertise,
  experience, and opinions. This has motivated a burgeoning field of research within software engineering that uses
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, such as machine learning, to mine Big Code for relevant insights, i.e.,
  &quot;intelligence&quot;, and use it to power next-generation software engineering solutions. In this talk I will
  provide an overview of research conducted at Fujitsu Laboratories of America, in the area of intelligence-driven
  software engineering, in the context of the larger body of work in this upcoming area. In particular, I will discuss
  our research in the areas of automated testing, debugging and patching, as well as our efforts to translate this
  research into practical solutions to help real users to be more productive and to develop more correct and reliable
  software.
